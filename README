lis_cmap

This repository contains htdocs, templates & configuration for the site:
http://cmap.comparative-legumes.org/

1) Install CMAP from http://www.gmod.org

CMAP has it's own installation process and set of dependencies, which
is fully documented there.

2) The path to the conf file needs to be set in Constants.pm, e.g.

/usr/local/share/perl/{VER}/Bio/GMOD/CMap/Constants.pm

   #
   # The location of the configuration files.
   #
   use constant CONFIG_DIR => '/path/to/your/cmap.conf';
   use constant GLOBAL_CONFIG_FILE => 'global.conf';

3) Only the altered/added files are in this repository. The main file
of interest is cmap.conf/mysql.conf which contains map templates. The
htdocs and templates directories are included, even though they are
mostly just stock CMAP stuff, some are slightly modified, especially
index.html

4) The database password is blanked out in mysql.conf, and htpasswd
files, you will need to edit passwords back in.
